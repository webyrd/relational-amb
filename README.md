A Relational Exploration of McCarthy's amb

Code repository for William E. Byrd's FOSDEM 2022 Declarative and Minimalistic Computing Devroom talk.

Title:
A Relational Exploration of McCarthy's 'Amb'

Abstract:
We will investigate what weirdness occurs when John McCarthy's non-deterministic 'amb' operator is added to a LISP interpreter written in a relational style, in the miniKanren constraint logic programming language.

All code runs in Chez Scheme.
